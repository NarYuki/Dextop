Dextop is an open-source Android app that creates a virtual display and provides a desktop-like workspace using only a smartphone. It uses Stellar or Shizuku and Android system services to control app launching, window placement, touch input, orientation, and related desktop behavior.

## Compatibility

| Environment | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Samsung DeX (One UI 8 or later) | Fully supported | Currently the most complete environment. Features managed by DeX use Samsung's platform implementation. |
| Samsung DeX (earlier than One UI 8) | Limited and likely incompatible | Older DeX implementations may not provide the display and window-management behavior required by Dextop. |
| Google Pixel | Limited and incomplete | Depends on Android's freeform/desktop implementation and hidden API availability. Some features may not work. |
| OPPO ColorOS desktop | Limited and incomplete | The desktop can be displayed, but platform components such as the taskbar may not appear. |
| Xiaomi devices running HyperOS or later | Disabled | MIUI and HyperOS are not supported. |
| Other Android devices | Experimental | Virtual-display, mirroring, and freeform support varies by manufacturer, model, and OS update. |

Dextop probes device capabilities at runtime and tries compatible backends in order. It still depends on Android hidden APIs and OEM behavior, so results can differ between models and OS versions from the same manufacturer.

## System requirements

- Android 10 or later. Most devices require Android 14 or later for a usable desktop environment.
- [Stellar](https://github.com/roro2239/Stellar/releases) (default and recommended, especially on Android 16 or later) or [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku/releases)
- The selected service started through wireless debugging, ADB, or root
- Stellar or Shizuku permission granted to Dextop

Download Stellar with the **Download from GitHub** button in Dextop. On Android 16 or later, Stellar is recommended. If you use Shizuku on Android 16 or later, install its [GitHub Releases build](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku/releases), not the Play Store build. On Android 15 or earlier, the Play Store build can also be used. If both managers are installed, Dextop asks which one to use and preserves that selection until either manager is uninstalled.

If any part of wireless-debugging setup is unclear, follow **Start via wireless debugging** in the [official Shizuku setup guide](https://shizuku.rikka.app/guide/setup/); the same Android pairing flow also applies when starting Stellar wirelessly.

## Installation

The Google Play release is currently under review.

Download the latest APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/NarYuki/Dextop/releases/latest) and install it.

## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NarYuki/Dextop.git
cd Dextop
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build apk --debug
```

To contribute support for another device, read [Adding support for a device](docs/ADDING_DEVICE_SUPPORT.en.md). The Japanese guide is [available here](docs/ADDING_DEVICE_SUPPORT.md).

## Diagnostics

Open **Settings → App information → Operation log and device diagnostics** to view, copy, or share device specifications, capability probes, fallback results, and Dextop operation logs. Remove any personal information you do not want to publish before attaching a report to an issue.

## Device reports

Open **Settings → Device report** to report how Dextop works on a specific device and firmware. Choose **Working**, **Not working**, or **Not tested** for the overall result and every listed feature, add optional notes, then tap **Send report by email**. Dextop prepares a structured Markdown report and opens your email app with `dextop-device@n4t.su` as the recipient.

The report includes the device model, codename, Android/API version, firmware identifiers, security patch, Dextop version, detected capabilities, and the results you selected. Review the generated email before sending it. See [Device reports](https://github.com/NarYuki/Dextop/wiki/Device-Reports) for the complete field list and procedure.

This project is under active development. Available features and behavior may change with device firmware and Android updates.
