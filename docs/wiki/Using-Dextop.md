# Using Dextop

## Start a desktop session

1. Open the Home screen.
2. Select a resolution profile.
3. Select landscape or portrait orientation.
4. Tap **Start**.

Dextop creates a virtual display, selects the device-specific desktop backend, attaches the mirrored surface, and launches the desktop HOME activity.

## Stop a session

Tap **Stop** from Dextop or use the stop action in the operation overlay. Dextop removes its virtual display and restores temporary Android settings recorded in the session journal.

## App launcher

Open **App launcher** to search installed launcher apps and launch them on the Dextop display. App availability and window behavior depend on whether each application supports resizing and secondary displays.

## Workspaces

A workspace stores a group of applications and their assigned positions.

- Create or edit a workspace from **Apps and workspace**.
- Choose a predefined layout and assign apps to positions.
- Launch a saved workspace from Home or the desktop operation overlay.
- Reorder, duplicate, delete, import, or export workspaces.
- Exported workspaces use Dextop JSON and can be copied between installations.

## Resolution profiles

The device profile uses the detected physical size and a readable density. Custom profiles can specify width, height, and DPI. Profiles may be edited or deleted while a session is stopped.

## Quick Settings tiles

Dextop adds two tiles to Android Quick Settings:

- **Dextop** opens Dextop and returns to the last workspace flow.
- **Dextop Display** toggles the virtual display directly, using the resolution, orientation, and secure-display settings saved in the app: while no session runs it starts the display and then steps back so the Dextop overlay owns the screen, and while a session runs it stops it.

A display start that cannot complete (for example because the privileged service is unavailable) keeps the app open so the reason stays visible. Exact tile behavior varies with Android and OEM restrictions.

## Home screen shortcut

The Dextop launcher shortcut toggles the virtual display without opening the app first.

- From Home, tap **Add home screen shortcut** below the Start button and confirm the launcher dialog.
- Long-press the Dextop app icon and choose **Start Dextop** for the shortcut menu entry.

The shortcut uses the saved resolution, orientation, and secure-display settings. Tapping it starts the display, and tapping it again stops the running session, exactly like the **Dextop Display** tile. Whether pinned shortcuts are supported varies with Android and OEM restrictions.
