# Device Compatibility

Compatibility is recorded per model **and firmware build**. A successful result on one device does not imply support for every model from the same vendor or for future OS updates.

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ Confirmed working | Dextop was launched and used successfully on the listed build. |
| 🟡 Partial | Dextop starts, but one or more important functions are unavailable or unstable. |
| 🧪 Experimental | A device profile or generic backend exists, but the exact model/build has not been verified. |
| ❌ Not working | The listed build has a known blocking issue. |

<details>
<summary><strong>Samsung</strong></summary>

Samsung DeX is mostly supported and is currently the most complete environment. Dextop avoids generic freeform changes that could conflict with Samsung's platform-managed desktop implementation.
